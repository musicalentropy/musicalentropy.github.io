title: My other contributions to KVR Developer Challenges
---

In this new post, I'm going to talk a little about the things I did in the past.

I choose the brand name Musical Entropy 4 years ago when I release [Inspiration](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/inspiration-by-musical-entropy/details), my take on the concept of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies ported into a standalone application and inspired by some of my lectures from that time. It was for [KVR Developer Challenge 2012](http://www.kvraudio.com/kvr-developer-challenge/2012/), and I think I helped a few people with it to find ways to fight the blank page syndrom. I really loved at this time to start creating things on my own and releasing them.

Two years later, it was [Guitar Gadgets](http://www.kvraudio.com/product/guitar-gadgets-by-musical-entropy/details), a VST/AU plug-in which was a compilation of "fake analog pedals", a way to present a few audio effects algorithms put together in the same place, and which could be very interesting for guitarists. I was designed for [KVR Developer Challenge 2014](http://www.kvraudio.com/kvr-developer-challenge/2014/), and I updated it a few times after the end of the contest. From time to time, I can see that some people are still using it, and I'm very happy about that.

When I created it, I had just started to be a freelance developer, after having worked with the company Two Notes on the Torpedo product line for a couple of years. Today, I'm still working with them from time to time, and with a few other companies (I've made some contributions to [Sonic Academy Kick 2](https://www.sonicacademy.com/products/kick-2) or [TSE X50](https://www.sonicacademy.com/products/kick-2) for example). I'll probably release more personal stuff next year !
