title: New blog on GitHub pages

Hello everybody !

I have moved my main blog here, on GitHub Pages, because it's easier to create new posts here, and because I wanted to try another blog platform. I'm probably going to update my website also very soon. 

So, welcome in the new blog of Musical Entropy, and I promise I'm going to be more active than before around here, so stay tuned, and thanks for watching !
